# What We're Going to Do

## MVP
- default function determining sun/shade
- input tree origin
- input number of years
- watch tree area grow over number of years from tree origin determined by function

## Stretch Goals
- choose function determining sun/shade
  - maybe choose % sun/shade, generates function?
- implement other factors besides sun/shade in tree growth (such as rain, nutrients, etc.)
- implement in 3D, with tree height

## In More Detail
Tree gets an annual increase in area and performs optimization to decide which area to take up

- area alloted per year
  - MVP: constant area per year
  - maybe function of area dependent on current area and year, more factors (like sun)
- optimization
  -
